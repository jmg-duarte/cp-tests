\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily]
Exception in thread "main"
java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException
    at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)
    at java.lang.Object.wait(Object.java:502)
    at WaNot.amethod(WaNot.java:11)
    at WaNot.main(WaNot.java:5)
\end{lstlisting}

This happens because the thread is not the owner of the object monitor.
If \texttt{amethod} was \texttt{synchronized} the program just blocks.
